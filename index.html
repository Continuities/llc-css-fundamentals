      ##Setting Up Our Dev Tools

      **[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)** - a text editor with colour highlighting and other helpful features. If you are unable to install Sublime Text, try installing: [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Mac).

      **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)** - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. To set Chrome as your default browser, follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en). Another good option is Firefox. Visit [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com) for more info about modern browsers.

      **Developer tools** allow us to *inspect* any web page to see how it's built. These tools also make it easier to test and debug code. The tools can be accessed in 3 ways:
      
      * right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element**
      * select the menu icon in the top right hand corner of the Chrome browser and select **Tools > Developer Tools**
      * keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl + Shift + I** (PC) / **Cmnd + Option + I** (Mac)
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Setting Up Our Work Flow

      Open our project files in the browser and text editor.

      1. Open Sublime Text and go to **File > Open**.

        ![](img/1-setup.png)
      1. Navigate to the **Project** folder (in the folder you downloaded with today's slides). With the entire folder selected, select **Open**.

        ![](img/2-setup.png)
      1. The folder will appear in Sublime's side bar. Double click on **index.html** in the sidebar to open it.

        ![](img/3-setup.png)
      1. Right click or two finger tap and select **Open in Browser**. This will open the HTML file in your *default* browser.

        ![](img/4-setup.png)

      No CSS has been applied yet so all you will see is the HTML content and the default styles like in [this example](examples/1-no-css.html).
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##HTML: Quick Review
      
      HTML is used to define *content* so use the appropriate tag that best describes the meaning of your content.

      **Headings**: There are 6 heading tags available (`&lt;h1&gt;,&lt;h2&gt;,...,&lt;h6&gt;`) and follow a hierarchical structure. `&lt;h1&gt;` represents the most important title/heading on the page and it's best to stick to using it just once per page. Other headings can be used multiple times.  It's important to use the appropriate tag to describe the content, not for the default heading styles. That's what CSS is for!

      ```xml
      &lt;h1&gt;Most Important Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Important But Not As Much As h1&lt;/h2&gt;
      ```

      **Paragraphs**: Created with the `&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;` tags.
      ```xml
      &lt;p&gt;I'm a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
      ```

      **Link**: requires the addition of a `src` *attribute* to specify where to link to.
      
      ```
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://website.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      ```

      **Lists**: There are two kinds of lists: ordered (`ol`) for numbered lists & undordered (`ul`) for lists with bullets. Content must be included only within the list item (`li`).
      
      ```xml
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ol&gt;
      ```
      **Images**: like links, also requires the an additional attribute, `src`, for linking to the image file.

      ```
      &lt;img src=&quot;path/to/image.jpg&quot;&gt;
      ```

    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Exercise #1: Personalize the content (15 mins)

      1. Update your name and tagline in the `header` section.
      2. Update your profile / personal summary / profile image, if you have a picture handy.

      Don't forget to save your changes!  
      Save the file using **File > Save**, or use keyboard shortcuts (**CMD + S** or **CNTL + S**)

      After saving, just refresh the browser to see the changes (rather than opening your file in a new tab every time). Find a work flow that works best for you when making frequent changes. 
      
      Don't worry if you don't finish. There's placeholder content already included in the starter template.

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##CSS Overview

      HTML defines *content*, CSS defines the *presentation*.
    
      <!-- CSS is made up of rules that reference HTML elements (like `p` and `ul`) and define what those elements should look like.
      A CSS rule is made up of a **selector** and one or more **declarations**.

      A declaration tells the browser what style to apply to the selected element and is always made up of two parts: a **property** and a **value**. A **property** tells the browser what is being modified (ex. font, colour, size). A **value** tells the browser *how* to modify the property (ex. Arial, green, 12px). -->
      **Selectors:** used to determine which element(s) to apply the styles to. Can target an HTML tag, class or ID.  
      **Declaration block:** consists of a list of declarations (rules to follow) wrapped in curly braces `{}`.  
      **Declarations** or rules to follow, are written using `property:value` pairs.

        selector {
          property: value;
        }

      **Properties** determine the type of style to be applied to
      the element (e.g. color).

      **Values** are specific to the property. Declarations must end with a semi-colon (`;`) to indicate that the instruction is complete.

      <ul>
        <li>Which one is the selector? <br>
          <span class="delayed">h1</span>
        </li>
        <li class="delayed">Which one is the property? <br>
          <span class="delayed">color &amp; font-size</span>
        </li>
        <li class="delayed">Which one is the value? <br>
          <span class="delayed">blue &amp; 12px</span>
        </li>
      </ul>        
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Comments
      
      Comments in CSS are written between a slash & asterix (`/* */`) and must close in the opposite order. Comments are great for ... well... leaving comments!  

      Leave comments in your code as notes for yourself or others or for organizing your code blocks. It is also used for "commenting" out your code, meaning hiding it so it doesn't render but not deleting it.
      
      ```
      /* GLOBAL STYLES */
      p {
        color: #cc0066; /* magenta */
      }

      /* HEADER STYLES */
      header {
        width: 80%;
      }

      /*  Saving this for later
      .slider {
        width: 100px;
        background: red;
      }
      */ 
      ``` 
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Classes vs IDs
      
      When **type selectors** are too general (targeting the HTML element), **classes** and **ids** can be used. HTML gives us two ways to attach extra identifying information to target specific elements with two **attributes**, `class` and `id`.  
      ``` 
      /* targets ALL parapraphs */
      p {
        color: red;
      }
      /* only applies to the element that contains this class */
      .danger {
        color: red;
      }
      /* only applies to the element that contains this id  */
      #danger {
        color: red;
      }
      ```
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Class Selectors

      A `class` **attribute** can be added to any element but the value is defined by you.  The class can then be used as a selector to apply styles to *any* element that references the class attribute.  
      
      In CSS, a `class` selector is defined by a leading period (`.`) followed by the class name with *no* spaces as your CSS selector. 
      Classes can be used multiple times on the same page. 

      ```xml
      &lt;p&gt;Regular text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;fancy&quot;&gt;Fancy text here.&lt;/p&gt;
      ```
      ```
      p {
        color: red;
        font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;
      }
      .fancy {
        text-transform: uppercase;
      }
      ```
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##id Selectors

      `id` **attributes** are similar to `class` **attributes** because it can also be added to any element and given any value.

      However, it can be used only *once* per page.  IDs should be used for significant style rules and is usually reserved for structural blocks. Some developers prefer not to use IDs at all for CSS styling because of specificity rules and classes can be used multiple times, making it more flexible.

      In CSS, IDs are denoted by a leading number symbol (`#`).
      ```
      #header {
        width: 800px;
      }
      ```
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##class and id Naming Conventions

      When choosing a class or id name, choose a descriptive name and do not use spaces. Hyphens (-), underscores (_) and camel case are acceptable. CSS is also case sensitive, so while these three examples look similar, CSS will read these as three different classes so it's important (for you own sanity) to pick one style and be consistent.
      
      ```
      class="content-wrapper"
      class="content_wrapper"
      class="contentWrapper"
      ```

      <h2>Adding Background Colours</h2>
      <p>Using the <code>background</code> (shorthand) or <code>background-color</code> (longhand) property to add colours to various page sections can be very useful when laying out the CSS for your HTML document. For now, you can use either.  We will be going more in depth with the various background options. Try changing the color below and see what happens!</p>

      <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#bg-shorthand">background: lightblue;</textarea>
      <div id="bg-shorthand">
        <p>Change the background using shorthand!</p>

      <div id="bg-longhand">
        <p>Change the background using longhand!</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##color Property and Values

      The `color` property accepts different types of values.

      **keywords** - you can use the actual name of the colour for most basic colours (red, green, blue, pink, etc) as well as a few fancy ones like "papayaWhip" and "paleGoldenrod".

      **RGB (red-green-blue)** - Uses *three* numerical values from 0-255. 0 represents black and 255 represents white. See below for syntax.

      **hex code** - Made up of the number sign (`#`) followed by six hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F) or three hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F).
      
      ```
      p {
        background: firebrick;
      }
      p {
        background: #B22222;
      }
      p {
        background: rgb(178,34,34);
      }

      ##Referencing CSS

      There are three ways to include (otherwise known as *referencing*) CSS in an HTML page.

      ###Inline
      Can be used in any HTML element using the `style` *attribute*.

      ```
      &lt;p style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;I'm writing CSS!&lt;/p&gt;
      ```

      This technique should be avoided but it's good to know how it works in case you encounter it "in the wild."

      ###Internal
      Uses `&lt;style&gt;` and is included in the `&lt;head&gt;` element.

      ```    
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;style&gt;
          h1 {
           font-size: 16px;
          }
        &lt;/style&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm still writing CSS!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      ```

      This method is preferred over *inline* css, however it is still inefficient because if you had multiple web pages, you would have to copy the style block to every single page to duplicate the styles.

      ###External
      Links to an separate style sheet file. This method is recommended because it separates the CSS from the HTML document. The link to the stylesheet is referenced in the `&lt;head&gt;` on any page where these styles need to be included. Only the CSS file needs to be updated rather than the CSS block on every single page.

      Referenced in the head element with a `&lt;link&gt;` tag and two **attributes**, `rel` and `href`. Just like creating links, the value of the `href` points to the location of the stylesheet.  The `rel` attribute describes the relationship.
      
      ```
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
        &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      ```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Exercise 2: add background colours (15mins)

      1. Use comments to organize your CSS.
      
      1. Using `background` or `background-color`, add a different background colour to each major section of the page.  Use an **element selector** for the header and **class selectors** for the sections. Since there are multiple `&lt;section&gt;` tags, we need to use a more specific selector to give them each a different colour.  Here are the selectors to get started: 
      
      ```
      header { }  
      .profile { }  
      .work-experience { }  
      .skills { }  
      .education { }  
      .contact { }
      ```

      Your page should look something like this: [background colour example](examples/2-bg-colours.html).
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Default styles: Reset vs Normalize</h2>

      <p>Every browser has its own default ‘user agent’ stylesheet to add default styles to the html elements. (ex. links are blue, h1 are bigger than h2)</p>

      <p>A <strong>CSS Reset</strong> is a set of CSS rules that resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent baseline to avoiding cross-browser differences as much as possible.  <strong>Normalize</strong> is slightly different because it "normalizes" the default styling rather than removes the default styles.</p>

      <p>Note that if you add it as a separate stylesheet, it should be included <em>before</em> your custom stylesheet.</p>

      <p>These various stylesheets can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.cssreset.com/">cssreset.com</a> but for today, it’s already included in the <strong>Projects</strong> folder.</p>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Cascading, Inheritance and Specificity

      CSS executes from top to bottom (hence "cascading"). So be careful of the the order of your CSS declarations. The declaration that comes *after* will override the one that came before.

      In this example, what colour will the `&lt;h1&gt;` be?

      ```
      h1 {
        color: black;
      }
      h1 {
        color: blue;
      }
      ```
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Cascading, Inheritance and Specificity

      One of the strengths of CSS is styles can be inherited from parent to child elements using the family tree relationship between the elements.

      ```
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;My Website&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;!-- child of body --&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- sibling of h1 and below p tag --&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      ```
      ```
      body {
        color: blue;
        font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
      }
      h1 {
        color: black;
      }
      ```

      In the above example, the CSS properties to the body selector is inherited by the children and descendants so all the text would be blue and display the Helvetica font. 

      However, when a more specific selector is used (`h1`), it overrides the inherited values because it's more *specific*.

      ##Web safe fonts

      The default font can be changed with the `font-family` **property**. However, not all fonts are installed on all computers so it's recommended to use fonts that are considered *web safe* &mdash; fonts that are commonly included on most computers.

      It's best practice to list at least two or three font options to provide a fall-back if the user doesn't have the preferred fonts installed.

      ```
      font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
      ```

      Here's a handy resource for referencing web safe fonts: [CSS Font Stack](http://cssfontstack.com/).
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Custom fonts

      For more options than just using the web safe fonts, services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) and [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) can make it easier to use a variety of fonts that aren't normally supported by all computers.

      A service like **Font Squirrel** requires you to download the fonts and add it to your project files. The site features a handy [generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) to create different font files to support various browsers as well as include demo files and instructions on how to use it. 

      **Google Fonts** allows you to link directly to their stylesheet and no file downloads are necessary. To use these fonts:

      * Select the fonts you want to use and **Add to Collection**.  
      * You can **Review** them to take a closer look, then choose *Use* when ready.
      * Select font weights. The more you choose, the more it will slow down page load time.
      * The default character set should contain what you need. Only select an option if you need to add additional language support.
      * Grab the `&lt;link&gt;` code snippet and add it the `&lt;head&gt;` part of your page.
      * Use the new fonts with the `font-family` property as listed in the example on the Google Fonts page.

      That's it!

      ##Refactor!

      What is refactoring? Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code to make it more efficient.

      Writing clean, organized and efficient code will not only make your pages run faster but will makie it easier to maintain and can potentially reduce browser bugs. It's tempting to say "I'll fix it later" but later doesn't always come. It's important to refactor your code as you go along.

      If you find you are declaring the same styles over and over again, try *combining selectors*, using a `class` or apply the style to a parent selector so the styles can be inherited.

      Combining selectors allows you to apply the same styles to multiple selectors.  Make sure to separate selectors with a comma.

      ```
      h1, h2 {
        /* will apply any styles here to both headings */
      }
      ```
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Exercise #3 Typography (continued)

      The previous example can be refactored to look like this:
      
      ```
      h1, h2, h3 {
        font-weight: 400;
      }
      h2, h3 {
        font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        text-transform: uppercase;
      }
      h1 {
        font-family: "Brush Script MT", cursive;
        font-size: 80px;
      }
      h2 {
        font-size: 32px;

      <h1>The Box Model</h1>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##What is The Box Model?

      The browser looks at every HTML element on the page as a rectangular box. The CSS Box Model describes the way CSS styles the size and spacing of HTML elements.

      Understanding the box model is crucial for understanding how to position elements with CSS to create the desired page layout. This is one of the trickiest part of CSS, so don't worry if it seems confusing!

      CSS uses 5 properties to determine the size and spacing of these boxes:

      * `margin` - adds/removes space *outside* of the element
      * `padding` - adds/removes space *inside* of the element
      * `border` - adds a border outside of the element
      * `width` - can be set to a specific size via CSS
      * `height` - can be set to a specific size via CSS
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Padding and Margin</h2>

      <p>The <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> can both be declared using similar syntax of 1 to 4 values. Values can be declared using different measurement units but pixels or percentages are most commonly used. Setting the value to "0" will <strong>remove</strong> any default space on an HTML element. Any positive value will <strong>add</strong> space.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>4 values mean top, right, bottom, left</li>
        <li>3 values mean top, right/left, bottom</li>
        <li>2 values means top/bottom, right/left</li>
        <li>1 value means the same amount of padding on all sides</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Change some values to see the difference between margin and padding. Let's also inspect the element using Chrome's Developer tool.</p>

      <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#padding">background: lightblue; 
padding: 0 0 0 0;
margin: 0 0 0 0;</textarea>
      <p id="padding">padding and margin test</p>
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Padding and Margin (continued)
      The previous slide uses the shorthand properties. Both can also be declared by specifying a particular side.

      ```
      padding-top: 10px;
      padding-right: 10px;
      padding-bottom: 10px;
      padding-left: 10px;
      ```
      ```
      margin-top: 10px;
      margin-right: 10px;
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      margin-left: 10px;
      ```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Border

      The `border` property resides between the `margin` and `padding` and creates an outline around the element. It, too, has longhand and shorthand syntax.
      
      ```
      /* longhand */
      border-width: 2px;
      border-style: solid;
      border-color: red;

      /* shorthand */
      border: 2px solid red;
      ```
      Like padding and margin, a specific side of the element can be specified.
      
      ```
      /* longhand */
      border-top-width: 2px;
      border-top-style: solid;
      border-top-color: red;

      /* shorthand */
      border-top: 2px solid red;
      ```

      ##Class exercise
      1. Add the box model fix to our CSS file. [link](/#slide38)

      1. Go back to our HTML & CSS project files, add `padding:1px` to the `header` section to see how it changes the spacing. Open up the Chrome Dev Tools and inspect the element.

      1. The content is also too wide.  Let's use the `margin: 0 auto` trick to center align the content. Try adding the styles to the `.profile` section in your CSS file.
      
      ```
      .profile {
        width: 1000px;
        margin: 0 auto;
      }
      ```
      Your page will look something like this:

      ![](img/margin-auto.png)
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Class exercise (continued)</h2>

      <p>The content is centered but now the background colour is restricted to the same width dimensions and doesn’t span the rest of the page anymore.  To fix this, we’ll need to create a “container” just for center aligning the content.</p>

      <p>Let’s add a new <code>div</code> with a class of <code>content-wrap</code> <em>around all the profile content</em>.</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;section class="profile"&gt;
  &lt;div class="content-wrap"&gt;&lt;!-- new content wrap div --&gt;

      &lt;img src="images/profile-generic.jpg" alt="Your Name"&gt;
      &lt;div class="summary"&gt;
          ...
      &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- close contact wrap div --&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>

      <p>Then apply the styles to <code>.content-wrap</code> instead of <code>.profile</code>. Let's add some padding while we're at it too.</p>
      <pre><code>.content-wrap {
  width: 1000px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 60px 0;
}
</code></pre>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>width &amp; max-width, px vs %</h2>
      
      <p>The content is all nice and centered now but what happens when the browser window is smaller than the set width?</p>

      <p>Let’s look at the difference between the <code>max-width</code> and <code>width</code> property and using percentages and pixels.</p>

      <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#widths">border: 1px solid black;
margin: 0 auto;
width: 90%;
max-width: 1000px;
      </textarea>
      <div id="widths">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Class exercise

      Update the `.content-wrap` styles to include `max-width` and update `width`.
      
      ```
      .content-wrap {
        max-width: 1000px;
        width: 90%;
        margin: 0 auto;
        padding: 60px 0;
      }
      ```

      Now we've created a reusable style that will help to keep our CSS nice and neat because we can apply this where ever this style is required, using the same class!

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Exercise #4: Content wrappers! (15mins)

      Add the `.content-wrap` to each section *except* the `header`.  We'll talk about why we're not adding this style to header after this exercise.

      Let's go over how to collapse code blocks and tab multiple lines at the same time in Sublime first, to help make this addition easier.

      Your page should look something like this: [example 4](examples/4-content-wrap.html).
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ## The Dangers of "div-itis"
      
      Be careful of "divitis"! Use the `&lt;div&gt;` to *group* related elements to be styled *together* as one section.  If you need to style a single element, like an `&lt;h1&gt;` for example, just style that element directly. The browser sees every element as a "box" so there's no need to put a box around a box!

      A good rule of thumb is to only add what you need.  It's much easier to add more than to remove extra markup.
    </section>
    <section class="slide image-only" data-markdown>
      ##Avoid code bloat

      ![](img/bloat.jpg)
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Update header & heading styles
    
      In the case of the `header` section, we can apply `text-align: center` instead of adding the `.content-wrap` since the content is short, we don't have to worry about containing it in a wrapper.

      Let's also adjust the padding to add some more space in the header.

      The final code for header should look like this:
      
      ```
      header {
        background: #2c3e50;
        text-align: center;
        padding: 150px 0;
      }
      ```

      While we're here, let's remove all of the default margins for the headings to get more control over how the spacing later on. Add `margin: 0` to the existing code block for the headers.
      ```
      h1, h2, h3 {
        font-weight: 400;
        margin: 0;
      }
      ```

      Your page should now look like this: [Example](examples/5a-heading-headers.html)

      #Background images
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Background images
      
      So far we've used `background` for colours but can also use it for setting background images.
      
      ```
      background-image: url(path/to/file.jpg); /* longhand */
      background: url(path/to/file.jpg);/* shorthand */
      ```
      ###File Structure
      Since our CSS file in *inside* a folder, we have to use `../` to go *up and out* of the folder to find the image files.

      ```
      background: url(../images/background-1.jpg);
      ```
      
      Note how the images repeat. We can override that with another property, `background-repeat` or just add it to the shorthand `background` property.
      
      ```
      /* shorthand */
      background: url(../images/background-1.jpg) no-repeat; 

      /* longhand */
      background-image: url(../images/background-1.jpg); 
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      ```
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Fluid background images

      CSS3 introduced the `background-size` property to make a background images fluid and flexible. The syntax is:

      ```
      background-size: width height;
      ```

      The default values for width and height are `auto` and retains the original image dimensions. If only one value is defined, it is assumed to be the `width`. The height will be set to auto and the image will keep its aspect ratio.

      There are several ways to define sizing dimensions using various types of values (px, percentages, keywords, etc).

      `background-size` is the longhand property.  To include it in the shorthand `background` property, it *must* be included after `background-position`, separated with the `/` character.  
      
      ```
      header {
        background-image: url(../images/background-1.jpg);
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: 50%;
        background-size: 100%;
      }
      ```
      ```
      header {
        background: url(../images/background-1.jpg) no-repeat 50% / 100%;
      }
      ```
      If no background position value is being used, background-size won't work in the shorthand property so in this case, it may be less error prone to add it via the longhand property.
      
      ```
      header {
        background: url(../images/background-1.jpg) no-repeat 50%;
        background-size: 100%;
      }
      ```
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##More About Background

      `background-size` also accepts keyword values, `contain` and `cover`.

      `contain` scales the image to fit its container. The image will grow or shrink proportionally but the width and height will not exceed the container's dimensions.

      `cover` scales the image to fit the entire container but, if that has a different aspect ratio, the image will be cropped.

      Let's add one more property, `background-attachment`.  Set the value to fixed and see what happens! (This can be added to the shorthand property)

      ```
      background: url(../images/background-2.jpg) no-repeat fixed 50%;
      ```
    </section>

      ##Exercise 5: Update header background styles (10mins)

      Based on the previous slides, update your header's background image and styles.  There are a few images in your **Project** folder to choose from or add one of your own.

      #Inline & Block
      #Elements
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Inline vs Block Elements
      By default, some HTML elements are displayed as block or inline elements.

      ###Block Elements

      * takes up 100% width of its container, no matter how long the actual content is
      * will be the same height as its content
      * always starts on a new line
      * can wrap other block level elements or inline elements
      * can apply sizing related CSS to it (margin, padding, height, width)

      ###Inline Elements

      * will be the height and width of its content
      * always appears "in a line" with other inline level elements
      * can wrap other inline elements but cannot wrap block level elements *except* `&lt;a&gt;` tags.  This is only valid with an HTML5 doctype.
      * does not render CSS height and width at all, will apply margin and padding but with unexpected results

      ###Inline-block

      * best of both worlds
      * floats left and is the size & height of its content, like inline elements
      * accepts height and width values like block elements

      ##CSS Display property

      These default display styles can be changed using the CSS `display` property.

      `display: inline` can be used to get block level elements to line up side by side, in a line. The only problem is the block level element will not render sizing properties, just like default inline elements.

      `display: block` can be used to make inline elements behave like a block level element (be able to apply size related properties) but they will no longer sit side by side, in a line.

      `display: inline-block` is the best of both worlds. Elements will line up side by side and also render sizing properties.
      
      `display: none;` will hide the element.

      Let's go back to our previous example and try using the `display` property.
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##CSS Float Property

      Remember, block-style HTML elements like `&lt;p>`, `&lt;div>` and `&lt;section>` automatically start on a new line and stack on top of each other. To get two block elements to align side-by-side, the `float` property can be used as well. 

      CSS floats can float elements left or right.

      **However**, we have to break the natural stacking flow when an element is floated. This will cause any element *after* the floated element to try to move up beside it or just not display properly because we've disrupted the natural stacking flow. The parent container will also collapse.

      **Also**, if there is no width set, the element will float but the width will automatically be the width of its content.

      #More selectors & Using multiple classes
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Descendant selectors
      
      **Descendant selectors** - Matches any element that is a descendant of the element declared before it.
      
      ```css
      p a {
        /* targets only a tags nested inside of p tags */
      }
      .classname a {
        /* targets only a tags nested inside any element with the matching classname */
      }
      ```
      **Protip:** Just like Inception, never go more than three levels deep. Truth.

      ```
      nav ul li a span {
        /* NOOOOOOOOOOO */
      }
      ```

      Feel free to skip a level but be mindful of specificity rules. For example, `nav ul li a span` would override `nav a`.

      However, it’s generally easier to start with less specific selectors and make them more specific, as needed, rather than starting with very specific selectors and adding extra markup or classes to try to override the styles.

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Child & Adjacent selectors</h2>
      
      <p><strong>Child selectors</strong> - Only matches an element that is a <em>child</em> of the element declared before it.</p>
      
      <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#child-selector">#child-selector {
  background: lightblue;
}
#child-selector p > a {
  color: red;
}</textarea>
      <div id="child-selector">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. <a href="#0">link</a></p>
        <a href="#0">link</a>
      </div>
      
      <p><strong>Adjacent selectors</strong> - Matches any element immediately preceded by a sibling element E</p>

      <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#adjacent-selector">#adjacent-selector {
  background: gray;
}
#adjacent-selector p + a {
  color: red;

        <a href="#0">link</a>
      </div>
    </section>

      ##Using multiple classes

      It's common to use more than one class on one element to add different styles to it. To use multiple classes, declare it in the same class attribute but separate classes with a space.

      ```xml
      &lt;div class=&quot;class-1 class-2&quot;&gt;
        content here
      &lt;/div&gt;
      ```

      Any styles under `.class-1` AND `.class-2` will apply.

      To select two (or more) classes at the same time, use both names as the selector with *no* space.  This style will only apply if *both* classes are declared in the element.
      
      ```css
      .class-1.class-2 {
        /* will only apply if both classes exist */
      }
      ```
    </section>
      
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
    ##Class Exercise: Floats
    
    1.Add a float to profile image.
      
    ```
    .profile img {
      float: left;
    }
    ```
    What happens to the parent element when a child element is floated?

    2.Add the clearfix class to the parent element

    3.Next, let's make the image a relative size to the page and add margin to create space between the image and text.

    ```
    .profile img {
      float: left;
      width: 30%;
      margin-right: 2%;
    }
    ```

    4.If the text is longer than the image, it will wrap around it. Let's put a width on the profile summary and float it too.
    ```
    .summary {
      width: 68%;
      float: right;
    }
    ```
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Exercise 6: Add More Floats and borders (15mins)

      Let's add floats to the **Work Experience** section as well.  Here's a link to the [final project](project/final.html) again for reference and some hints to get you started:

      * In the HTML, the `.details` element contains the Company and date details and the `.description` element contains the job description. So we want to float `.details` left and `.descriptions` right.

      ```
      &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;details&quot;&gt;
          Company name, date, etc
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;
          Job description
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- close .item --&gt;
      ```
      * Remember, to float elements properly, declare a width as well.
      * What happens when elements are floated? The parent element *collapses* so make sure to fix that as well!


      If you have some extra time, feel free to follow these instructions for adding a border or tweak some font styles!

      * Each Work Experience item is contain in an element with `.item`.  Create a new declaration block for `.item` and add a `border-bottom` style to it.  The syntax is: `border-bottom: size style colour;`
      
      ```
      .item {
        border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
      }
      ```
      
      Your page should look something like this: [Example 6](examples/6-floats.html).

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##More Background & Font Styles

      It's time to get rid of these testing background colours and put in some nicer looking styles.

      * For the **Profile** section, let's add an opaque background style so we can see the header image behind it. We can use the `background` property again but this time with an RGBa value. The 'a' represents the alpha transparency. (There is an `opacity` property too but it makes the text opaque too so we'll use `background` instead).

      ```
      .profile {
        background: rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
      }
      ```

      Uh oh? Why didn't it work? The **Profile** and **Header** sections are *siblings* as in the elements come one after another.  In order for the image to show through, it has to be declared in an ancestor or parent element.  

      * Let's move the `background` styles from the `header` selector to `body`.

      * Change the font color in `.profile` to white, to see the text more clearly.

      * Pick an accent colour and apply it to all links (`a` tags).

      ##Keep going with Background styles (20mins)

      1. Update the **Work Experience** and **Education** section with the same background colour. The sample project is using a very light gray (#FEFEFC).

      1. Change the font colour of the Profile, Skills & Contact section to white or #ffffff.
      
      1. Add another background image to the **Skills** section. Don't worry about the overlay effect right now.  Just add the image.

      1. Add an underline to the `&lt;h2>` headings, #cccccc or a colour of your choosing. 

      1. Update the background colour for the Contact section. Use #111111 or a colour of your choosing.

      If you get stuck, ask a mentor! Don't worry if you don't finish, we'll go through it together as a class.

      #CSS3!
    </section>
        
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##CSS3 Properties: border-radius

      Let's take a break from tweaking spacing and floats and add some newer CSS3 features. 

      The introduction of CSS3 brought in new ways to do things that previously had to be done in Flash, JavaScript or complicated hacks.

      Let's start with `border-radius`.  Once upon a time, rounded corners required cutting images with transparent backgrounds and blah blah blah...  Now we can do it with one line of CSS!

      Let's add this style to the existing declaration block for the profile image. Percentages or pixel values can be used. The bigger the number, the more rounded the corners will be. To get a perfect circle, set the `border-radius` to 50% and the original image must also be a square (or else it will look oval).
      ```
      .profile img {
        border-radius: 50%;
      }
      ```

      Let's add a border and some padding. Remember, padding adds space *inside* of an element.
      ```
      .profile img {
        border-radius: 50%;
        border: 1px solid #ddd;
        padding: 4px;
      }
      ```
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      ##Vendor prefixes

      In some cases, to use a more advanced CSS3 styles, a standard CSS property may require an addition of a browser specific prefix. For example, the various prefixes for different browsers are as follows:

      * Chrome: `-webkit-` 
      * Firefox: `-moz- ` 
      * Internet Explorer: `-ms-`
      
      Not all properties these prefixes and as newer browser versions come up, support for many of these prefixes are no longer required.  Here's a couple handy resources. Let's look at the first two.

      * [css3please.com](http://css3please.com/)  
      * [-prefix-free](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/)  
      * [css-tricks.com/how-to-deal-with-vendor-prefixes](http://css-tricks.com/how-to-deal-with-vendor-prefixes/)

      -prefix-free has already been included in your project files and is linked in the `&lt;head>` like so:

      ```xml
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/prefixfree.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/ script&gt;

      <h2>Profile Heading Update</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Let’s update the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag in the profile section and give it a style different from the other headings.  First, we’ll override the bottom border.  We need to use a selector that is specific to the profile section. Add a background color too. Try using your accent colour. </p>
<pre><code>.profile h2 {
  border: none;
  background: #2980b9;

Then we’d have to set the width again. Remember, inline elements are as wide as their content so let’s change the heading to which display option?</p>
          <p class="delayed"><code>display: inline-block;</code> so we can access the block and inline behaviors. Let's add some padding too!</p>

      ##CSS3 Transform

      The `transform` property can be used to literally transform the element.  You can skew it, scale it and few other things.  Let's try adding just a slight `rotate` to it.  The value for `rotate` is defined in degrees.

      Add this declaration to the Profile heading. Try using positive or negative numbers until you find one that you like!

      ```
      .profile h2 {
        transform: rotate(-4deg);
      } 
      ```

##Markdown example

You can even write in Markdown as long as the `data-markdown` attribute is included. See the [documentation for markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  Both text and code blocks are supported at this time.  Code blocks need to be denoted either by three backticks (`) or by tabbing the content in one indent (at least 4 spaces).  Tabbing to create a code block won't work in this slide deck if your content begins tabbed in in your source code.

You can specify the language of the codeblock by following the three backticks immediately by the language name.  View the source to see this in action

#### Javascript Example

```javascript
var myJSVariable = "Syntax Highting for Javascript";
```

#### Css Example

```css
.css-selector{
  highlight : syntax;
}
```
#### indented example

  code block that has to guess at the language and likely gets it wrong.  it thinks this is applescript.
